Your molecule's pIC50 is lower than that of the target molecule. A lower binding affinity means that your drug will not bind to its target as strongly, and thus a higher dose will need to be taken for it to be effective.
Your drug is too lipophilic. This can lead to a large number of off-target effects, increasing side effects and potential toxicity. Adding polar functional groups to your drug can help to reduce this.
Your drug clearance is too high, which means it has a low metabolic stability. Patients will have to take large doses regularly in order to maintain a therapeutic concentration within their bloodstream, which is unpopular.
