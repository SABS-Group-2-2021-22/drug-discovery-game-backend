Your molecule's pIC50 is lower than that of the target molecule. A lower binding affinity means that your drug will not bind to its target as strongly, and thus a higher dose will need to be taken for it to be effective.
Your drug's lipophilicity is too low, thus it is likely to have poor ADMET properties. Adding alkyl chains or non-polar functional groups can increase a drug's lipophilicity.
Your drug clearance is too high, which means it has a low metabolic stability. Patients will have to take large doses regularly in order to maintain a therapeutic concentration within their bloodstream, which is unpopular.
