Your molecule's pIC50 is lower than that of the target molecule. A lower binding affinity means that your drug will not bind to its target as strongly, and thus a higher dose will need to be taken for it to be effective.
Your molecule's pIC50 is acceptably close to the target value. Your molecule will bind strongly to the target, so a lower dose is needed, which can minimise side effects.
pIC50 values are unfortunately not available for your molecule.
With respect to pIC50, your molecule is completely inactive.
With respect to pIC50, the assay unfortunately failed.
Your drug's lipophilicity is too low, thus it is likely to have poor ADMET properties. Adding alkyl chains or non-polar functional groups can increase a drug's lipophilicity.
Your drug's lipophilicity is good, thus it is likely to have good ADMET properties with minimal off-target effects.
Your drug is too lipophilic. Adding polar functional groups to your drug can help to reduce this.
Your drug clearance is too high, which means it has a low metabolic stability. Patients will have to take large doses regularly in order to maintain a therapeutic concentration within their bloodstream, which is unpopular.
Your drug's metabolic stability is good, so it is not cleared from the body too quickly, thus very frequent dosing is not necessary.
