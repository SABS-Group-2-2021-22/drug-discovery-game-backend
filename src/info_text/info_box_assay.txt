pIC50 is the negative base-10 logarithm of IC50 (molar units), the concentration of ligand required to inhibit the enzyme response by half. The higher the pIC50, the more potent the inhibitor; pIC50 typically ranges from 2 (very weak inhibitors) to 12 (very potent inhibitors).
The time it takes for a compound to pass through a mouse is often a useful indicator for human clearance times, but at lower assay cost and time. [range]
The time it takes for a compound to be metabolised and clear the human body indicates the rate of administration required to maintain a stable drug concentration.
logD is the distribution coefficient, a measure of lipophilicity. It's often determined by measuring the partition of a compound between an organic solvent and an aqueous buffer. This can influence multiple ADMET properties; high logD values correspond with poor aqeous solubility, which can limit intestinal absorption, for example. [distinction with logP]
The Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay (PAMPA) provides an in vitro measure of passive, transcellular permeability of a compound. The higher the PAMPA value, the greater the permeation (larger values are better).
This function indicates whether a compound has passed or failed each Lipinski "Rule" of Five test, which indicates whether a compound is bioavailable or not.
The descriptors are those defined on the 'Build' page, but here describe parameters of the whole compound (not individual R groups).
Run the selected assays.
The Lipinski "Rule" of Five defines property boundaries for the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, the molecular weight, and logP (P is the octanol-water partition coefficient). The rule states orally actives drugs should not violate more than one of these criteria: no. H-bond donors ≤ 5, no. H-bond acceptors ≤ 10, MW ≤ 500 Da, logP ≤ 5.
These values (as well as the descriptors) provide quantitative measures of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET or AMDE-Tox); all of which are important properties for a succesful drug.
