The columns to the left contain the list of R groups for positions A and B on the scaffold molecule, respectively. 
The metrics below each image correspond to the:
 - Molecular weight (MW), 
 - Lipophilicity (logP),
 - Topological polar surface area (TPSA),
 - Number of heavy atoms (HA)
 - Number of hydrogen acceptors (H acc)
 - Number of hydrogen donors (H don)
 - Number of aromatic rings (Rings)
These properties are worth considering in the context of drug design. For example, MMP12 has a relatively small active site, and therefore large R groups and additional aromatic rings are unlikely to favour binding. One must also consider how strongly an optimal drug would bind, and thus how many interaction sites the target compound should posess. Furthermore, although drugs typically require some liphophilicity to allow membrane permeation, one usually aims for a logP value < 5 to facilitate solubility, for example (the Lipinski Rule of 5 and ADMET properties are discussed in further detail on the next page).
