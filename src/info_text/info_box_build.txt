The columns to the left contain the list of R groups for two positions on the scaffold molecule. Clicking on an R group in either column changes the molecule accordingly.
The metrics below each R group correspond to the:
 - Molecular weight (MW)
 - Lipophilicity (logP)
 - Topological polar surface area (TPSA)
 - Number of heavy atoms (HA)
 - Number of hydrogen acceptors (H acc)
 - Number of hydrogen donors (H don)
 - Number of aromatic rings (Rings)
These properties are worth considering in the context of drug design. For example, MMP12 has a relatively small active site, and therefore large R groups and additional aromatic rings are unlikely to favour binding. One must also consider how strongly an optimal drug would bind, and thus factors like the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors will affect its binding. Furthermore, although drugs typically require some liphophilicity to allow membrane permeation, one usually aims for a logP value < 5 to facilitate solubility. The Lipinski Rule of 5 and ADMET properties are discussed in further detail on the next page.
